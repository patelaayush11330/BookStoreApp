* Responsive login/logout navigation handled via **AuthProvider** context.

üß© Reusable Components

* `Cards`: Book display layout.
* `Navbar`: Navigation with theme toggle and authentication buttons.
* `Footer`: Static footer with links and social icons.

‚öôÔ∏è Working Mechanism

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Frontend Flow (React.js)

1. React Router integrates components like `Course`, `Freebook`, `Navbar`.
2. **Axios** fetches data from backend REST APIs.
3. Components render dynamic content (books/courses).
4. Authentication state is managed via Context and stored locally.

üñ•Ô∏è Backend Flow (Node.js + Express)

1. Handles:

   * User signup & login.
   * Book/course fetching and filtering.
2. Stores data in **MongoDB** using **Mongoose**.
3. API endpoints tested using **Postman**.
